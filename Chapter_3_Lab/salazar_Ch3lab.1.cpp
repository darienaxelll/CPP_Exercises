// Property Tax
//
// Madison County collects property taxes on the assessed value of property, which is 60 percent of its
// actual value. For example, if a house is valued at $158,000, its assessed value is $94,800. This is the
// amount the homeowner pays tax on. At last yearâ€™s tax rate of $2.64 for each $100 of assessed value,
// the annual property tax for this house would be $2502.72. Write a program that asks the user to input
// the actual value of a piece of property and the current tax rate for each $100 of assessed value. The
// program should then calculate and report how much annual property tax the homeowner will be
// charged for this property.
